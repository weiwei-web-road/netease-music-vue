# Netease Music
Re-design and implement Netease Music using Vue and Vuex. There's no 3rd party UI libraries used in this project. All components are designed and implemented only for this project.

## Online Demo @ Daocloud

> Since it's running on a free Docker host, I just can't guarantee it would be always working.
